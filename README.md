# NetLogo-extension: ql

Since ql is an extension of NetLogo, the latter must be installed first ([NetLogo 5.2.1](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.2.1/)). 

After NetLogo has been installed, a directory named `ql` should be created in the `extensions` subdirectory of the `NetLogo` installation ([see also](
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/extensions.html)). All files from `https://github.com/JZschache/NetLogo-ql/tree/master/extensions/ql` should be downloaded and 
moved to the newly created directory `extensions/ql`. For example:
>git clone https://github.com/JZschache/NetLogo-ql.git
>mv NetLogo-ql/extensions/ql path-to-netlogo/extensions
